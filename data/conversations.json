We're thrilled to host your birthday celebration.\n\nGreat news, we can make both the French 75 and the Somaek (we'll need to verify the exact grape soju brand you'd prefer to ensure availability).  Feel free to bring a mini-sign to promote them at the bar.\n\nYes, we do sell bottles.  We'll send you our bottle list shortly.\n\nSince you've confirmed you sent the deposit and attached your ID, you're all set! You'll receive a formal event invitation shortly with all the final details.\n\nPlease let us know if you have any other questions.\n\nBest,\n\nTacoTaco Events Team\n647-692-4768\neattaco.ca\n",
