To make sure everything is perfectly prepared for your big day, we'd love to get a final headcount from you. Can you confirm your selection for catering and guest count? Here's the full details again:We can offer light appetizers for $6 per person. This includes loaded nachos, jalapeno poppers, fries and pizzadilla. If you want to do two tacos+appetizers per person, we can do it for $16 per person. You can choose between 4-6 tacos and apps and can see the full menu here: eattaco.ca/menu. If you want a full plated buffet catering, it would be $30 per person. I've attached the plated buffet menu for reference.
