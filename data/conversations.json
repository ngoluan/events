Is there a name?4:00pm ish – I will be dropping off a little extra décor, a cake and a couple other things.My friends Mary and Gudrun will be arriving at 6:30pm to make sure they are there to greet early arrivers. If someone could show them how to hook up some music before the guests arrive, that would be great. I will probably switch to my phone when I get there.7:00pm arrival for our guests.7:15pm the birthday girl and myself will arrive8:00pm can we have the buffet set up please? Will that happen on the service counter or on tables? I think the counter makes the most sense. There won’t be any kids, so not worried about the height.Allergies: We do have two guests with celiac disease. Ideally, we have very clear direction on what they can eat. If need be, would there be the ability to make a plate if we concerns about cross-contamination?Cake: I will have a couple gluten free desserts for those folks. Should I bring paper plates/forks?Red Wine: As discussed, we want the birthday girl to happy so I picked up 8 bottles of Spanish red that she likes. Please use that as you r house red to start. If it runs out, then we switch to yours. Please charge me the corkage fee for each as they are used.Bar: We will have people pushing to pay for their own drinks. Please tell them not to argue with the bartender, they can argue with me. I will be picking up the tab. The only thing I would like to know is when we hit $1000 mark on alcohol. I assume it will be later?Music: As mentioned above, we will use the Bluetooth and manage all the musicTV: We will be playing a little trivia game at around 8:40 leading into karaoke. I will bring my computer and HDMI cable to connectKaraoke: That will probably start around 9:00pmMy assumption that being a Wednesday, people will start dispersing around 11:00 but we may have a few more people who need to sing.Thanks again for all your help making this easy for us.CHRIS ZIELINSKI | SENIOR DIRECTOR CULINARY MLSE50 Bay St. | Suite 500 | Toronto, ON M5J 2L2O: 416.815.5948 | M: 416.560.9198chris.zielinski@mlse.com | @chef_zee67[cid:image001.png@01DB3529.69609470]From: info@eattaco.ca Sent: Sunday, November 10, 2024 1:15 PMTo: Chris Zielinski Subject: Re: Re: Event Contract 11/13/2024Warning: External Email.
