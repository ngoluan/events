I'd like to book the dining room for Sat.Feb.8. Please let me know what the next steps are. Also, how is your cancellation policy,in case something comes up towards that day or if an emergency arises?By the way, regarding food,I'm interested in the appetizer menu for now.Thank you,Elvan On Wed, Nov 6, 2024, 1:21 p.m. Taco Taco <info@eattaco.ca> wrote:Hi Elvan,Correct! For 4 hours, it'd be $500 in terms of rental. Food packages would be a separate cost, and for lights apps. For food, we can offer light appetizers for $6 per person. This includes loaded nachos, jalapeno poppers, fries and mexican bruschetta. If you want to do two tacos+appetizers per person, we can do it for $16 per person. You can choose between 3-5 tacos and apps and can see the full menu here: eattaco.ca/menu. No need for exact number of guests! We ask for the final count 1 week before the event so we can relay it to staff if you order any catering.  Otherwise it doesn't matter to us.TacoTaco Events Team(647) 692-4768 | info@eattaco.ca eattaco.caOn Tue, Nov 5, 2024 at 9:15 PM elvan tayhani <elvantayhani@gmail.com> wrote:Hello,Thanks very much for your quick response. I'm still interested in booking the front dining space for Saturday, February 8th as mentioned before. I'm thinking of booking between 8pm and 12am. So it's going to be $500, right? Also, how is the process for the food service? How much is it going to be for around 25 people for appetizers? And I guess, that's a separate cost on top of the room booking fee, right?The other thing that I'm curious about is if it's possible to give you the exact number of guests later, like maybe a month before the event? Because, I'm not sure about the number right now...Please let me know, then we can start the booking process.Thanks so much,ElvanTaco Taco <info@eattaco.ca>, 4 Kas 2024 Pzt, 13:23 tarihinde şunu yazdı:Hi Elvan,Nice to meet you!
