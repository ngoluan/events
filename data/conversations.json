To help manage potential costs, we recommend setting a spending limit for an open bar. We can work with you to set a reasonable limit that suits your budget. We can also provide regular updates on the spending throughout the event.\n\nJust to confirm, your food choices are:\n\n* **Apps:** Mexican Street Corn, Bruschetta, Cauliflower Wings\n* **Sides:** Fries, Mexican Rice\n* **Mains:** Jerk Chicken, Shrimp, Butternut Squash\n* **Dessert:** Churros, Flan\n\nPlease let us know if you'd like to make any changes to these selections.  We'll get everything finalized for your event on November 24th.\n\nWe've received your deposit and ID, so your event is confirmed! You'll receive a formal event invite shortly.\n\nBest,\n\nTacoTaco Events Team\n647-692-4768\n",
