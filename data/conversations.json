Or is that when you stop service? Do all guests need to be out by 1am?\r\n  *\r\nFor setting up music, I have put together a Spotify playlist. Is that something I send to you guys in advance? Is it a bluetooth set up at the venue? Or does my phone need to be physically plugged in to the speaker?\r\n  *\r\nWill we have access to the front patio? Or is that an additional cost?\r\n     *\r\nMy friends were interested in setting up cornhole on the patio if possible.\r\n  *\r\nHow early would you recommend for us to come to set up some balloons?\r\n  *\r\nAm I able to bring some cupcakes or bowls of chips? If not, what would be the cost of getting about 20-25 servings of chips and dip?\r\n\r\nI think that's all the questions I have for now! I understand I still owe the remaining half of the balance, I will send that over to you in the next day or so.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nAlex\r\n________________________________\r\nFrom: Taco Taco <info@eattaco.ca>\r\nSent: November 18, 2024 9:10 PM\r\nTo: alexhickl@hotmail.com <alexhickl@hotmail.com>\r\nSubject: Re: Excited for your event on November 22nd\r\n\r\nHi Alexandra,\r\n\r\nHope all is well!

My name is Liem and I help with event inquiries here at Tacotaco. We would love to host you. The front dining space is available that day. The cost is $125/hr with a minimum spend of $1000 across food and drinks. The rental comes with the use of our sound system (including karaoke), bartending staff, party lights, a fully stocked cash bar and clean up. Let me know if you have any questions!\r\n\r\nFor food, we can offer light appetizers for $6 per person. This includes loaded nachos, jalapeno poppers, fries and pizzadilla. If you want to do two tacos+appetizers per person, we can do it for $16 per person. You can choose between 4-6 tacos and apps and can see the full menu here: eattaco.ca/menu<http://eattaco.ca/menu>. If you want a full plated buffet catering, it would be $30 per person. I've attached the plated buffet menu for reference. Let us know if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to provide drinks for your guests, you can purchase drink tickets at $8 each + tax & gratuity which covers all our drinks except for the cocktails. Or, you can set a budget for open bar and people can order from the open bar until that limit is reached.\r\n\r\nTacoTaco Events Team\r\n(647) 692-4768<https://www.google.com/search?q=tacotaco&oq=tacotaco&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIJCAEQABgKGIAEMhIIAhAuGAoYrwEYxwEYgAQYjgUyEAgDEC4YrwEYxwEYgAQYjgUyCQgEEAAYChiABDIHCAUQABiABDIGCAYQRRg9MgYIBxBFGEHSAQgxNjc3ajBqN6gCALACAA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#> | info@eattaco.ca<mailto:info@eattaco.ca>\r\neattaco.ca<http://eattaco.ca/>\r\n[https://ci3.googleusercontent.com/mail-sig/AIorK4wjvL-MtVuSN6X8zc1j6wpPf1GadtxF2McVDmk2PYfNnoXh3xNrxzL0PfmYSCHj-VCnCeXOXNIy-2vK]\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Wed, Nov 6, 2024 at 11:37 AM <luan.ngo@eattaco.ca<mailto:luan.ngo@eattaco.ca>> wrote:\r\n\r\nName: Fatima Mian\r\n\r\nPhone: 6477413115\r\n\r\nEmail: Fatima.Mian@D2L.com\r\n\r\nDescription: Hey, we'd love to host an event like a paint and sip for a corporate holiday party.
